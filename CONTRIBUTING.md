## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Check existing issues first to avoid duplicates
- Describe the problem clearly
- Include your use case—it helps us understand the context

### Suggesting Improvements

Open an issue with:
- What problem does this solve?
- How does it fit with the existing structure?
- Any downsides or tradeoffs?

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-improvement`
3. Make your changes
4. Test with a real project if possible
5. Submit a PR with clear description

## What We're Looking For

### High Value Additions
- Improvements to AI instruction clarity in `session-state.mdc`
- Better section structures for `PROJECT_STATE.md`
- Integration guides for other frameworks (Windsurf, Codium, etc.)
- Real-world usage patterns and examples

### Probably Not
- Framework-specific rules (those belong in separate repos like llm-cursor-rules)
- Complex automation scripts (keep it simple)
- Features that bloat the state file beyond ~100 lines

## Style Guidelines

### For .mdc Files
- Clear, imperative instructions
- Use "MUST", "DO", "DON'T" for emphasis
- Keep sections focused
- Include examples for complex behaviors

### For Markdown Templates
- Use HTML comments for AI instructions
- Keep placeholder text obvious: `[YYYY-MM-DD]`, `[Project Name]`
- Section headers should be scannable

### For Documentation
- Practical over theoretical
- Include code examples
- Show before/after comparisons when relevant
