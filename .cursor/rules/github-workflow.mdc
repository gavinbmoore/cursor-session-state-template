# GitHub Workflow Rules

Consistent patterns for commits, PRs, and issues.

## Commit Messages

### Format
```
<type>: <short description>

<optional body - what and why>
```

### Types
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `refactor:` - Code change that neither fixes nor adds
- `docs:` - Documentation only
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance (deps, config, etc.)

### Examples
```
feat: Add user authentication flow

fix: Resolve race condition in data fetching

refactor: Extract validation logic to separate module

docs: Update API documentation for v2 endpoints
```

### Guidelines
- First line under 72 characters
- Use imperative mood ("Add" not "Added")
- Body explains WHY, not just WHAT
- Reference issues when relevant: `Fixes #123`

## Branch Naming

```
<type>/<short-description>

feature/user-auth
fix/login-redirect
refactor/api-client
```

## Pull Requests

### Title
Same format as commits: `<type>: <description>`

### Body Template
```markdown
## Summary
Brief description of changes (2-3 sentences max)

## Changes
- Key change 1
- Key change 2

## Testing
How this was tested

## Related
Fixes #123 (if applicable)
```

### Before Creating PR
1. Ensure branch is up to date with main
2. All tests pass
3. Build succeeds
4. Self-review the diff

## Issues

### When to Create
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Tasks that need tracking

### Issue Body
```markdown
## Description
What is happening / what is needed

## Steps to Reproduce (bugs)
1. Step one
2. Step two

## Expected Behavior
What should happen

## Environment (if relevant)
- OS, browser, versions
```

## Git Operations

### Safe Practices
- Pull before starting work: `git pull origin main`
- Commit frequently with clear messages
- Push regularly to backup work

### Avoid
- Force pushing to shared branches
- Committing secrets or credentials
- Large commits with unrelated changes

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout -b feature/new-thing

# Commit changes
git add -p                    # Review changes interactively
git commit -m "feat: Add new thing"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin feature/new-thing
gh pr create --fill

# Update branch with main
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main

# Quick status
git status
git log --oneline -5
```
